      <h1>Scuba diving</h1>
      <p>
        Scuba diving is a hobby that has completely transformed my perspective
        on the world. I first tried diving 2 years ago in Capetown and I was
        instantly hooked. The feeling of weightlessness, combined with the
        incredible underwater world full of vibrant coral reefs and marine life,
        is something I canâ€™t quite explain. One of the most memorable diving
        experiences I've had took place at Sodwana Bay, located on the
        southeastern coast of KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa. Renowned for
        its exceptional marine biodiversity, Sodwana Bay is a top-tier diving
        destination that holds a special place in my diving journey.

      <h2>Hiking</h2>
      <p>
        Hiking has always been a passion of mine because it offers the perfect
        blend of physical challenge and connection with nature. Hiking allows me
        to escape the stresses of daily life and experience the tranquility of
        the great outdoors.
